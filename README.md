### Tuts+ Tutorial: Building a Shopping List Application With CloudKit: Adding Relationships

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the previous tutorial of this series, we add the ability to add, update, and remove shopping lists. A shopping list without any items in it isn't very useful though. In this tutorial, we'll add the ability to add, update, and remove items from a shopping list. This means that we'll be working with references and the CKReference class.
